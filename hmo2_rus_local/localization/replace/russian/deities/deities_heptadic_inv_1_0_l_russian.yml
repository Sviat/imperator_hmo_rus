The translation of which is simply 'the breastless,' referring to the myth that Amazonian women would cut off one breast in order to have less in the way when taking aim of a bow. The false etymology may have lead to the myth, however, Amazonian women are often depicted with both breasts, though often with one covered, and perhaps the non-mythology version of Amazonians instead breastfed with only one breast.\n\nThe Amazons, by their nature, may yeild greater rewards and benefits to female rulers."
